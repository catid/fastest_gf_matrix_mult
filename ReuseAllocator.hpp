	The reuse allocator is optimized to react to runtime requirements
	by keeping previously allocated buffers around for later re-use.

	These buffers are not aligned and are allocated off the CRT heap.

	All buffers are the same size.

	Allocation and deallocation are thread-safe.  It is optimized to
	be used for allocating in one thread and deallocating in another,
	since it uses two locks and only causes contention if the allocator
	runs out of space and needs to lazily move all the freed buffers
	into the acquire list.  In any case, the lock time is minimized.
